      <h1>One Experiment That Rewrote Physics</h1>
      <p class="meta">Published: 2025-11-19 · Category: Science</p>
      <p>
        In the early 20th century, a simple experiment forever changed how scientists think about the universe. The double-slit experiment, first performed by Thomas Young, showed that light behaves both as a wave and a particle—a finding that challenged centuries of physics and opened the door to quantum mechanics.
      </p>
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The double-slit experiment revealed the strange, probabilistic nature of reality. When particles like electrons are fired at a barrier with two slits, they create an interference pattern—unless observed, in which case the pattern disappears. This result suggests that observation itself affects physical outcomes, a concept that still puzzles scientists today.
      </p>
      <h2>The People Behind the Breakthrough</h2>
      <p>
        Thomas Young’s work was expanded by physicists like Niels Bohr, Richard Feynman, and Albert Einstein. Their debates and discoveries laid the foundation for quantum theory, which now powers technologies from lasers to computers.
      </p>
      <h2>In One Sentence</h2>
      <p>
        The double-slit experiment proved that reality is stranger than fiction, and that the act of measurement can change the outcome.
